# Powersidian
## Introduction
**Powersidian** is a PowerShell script that helps you export a whole Obsidian vault of notes easily and combine the exported PDFs into a single book.

## Requirements
- Obsidian.
- PowerShell. (version >= 7.4.6)
- pdftk Server
- This script only works on Windows, as it uses things like `System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys` for automation about file saving dialogs.

## How it Works & How to Use
The source code should be clear enough, as the configurations are explained by comments at the beginning of the script. You may (very possibily) need to modify it before using.
